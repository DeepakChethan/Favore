* A Social Networking site where people can dump images, voices and text based posts at specific locations and let random strangers who pass by that path read them.
* It is an android app with the nodejs as the background
* People can "favore" or repost the post from where there are at.
* Can add people to the friend list, remove them
* Posts last longer based on the "favoring". If nobody fovores it, the post will be deleted.
